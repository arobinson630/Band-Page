    ><p>Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup comprises
        vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell,
        DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and
        Chester Bennington are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park's earlier music
        spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop elements.

        Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000),
        which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak
        of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles "One Step Closer", "Crawling"
        and "In the End" all to chart highly on the Mainstream Rock chart; the latter crossed over to the pop chart.[1]
        Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success.[2] The band explored experimental sounds on
        their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).[3] By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most
        successful and popular rock acts.[4]

        The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010),
        layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical
        elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier
        rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was their first pop-oriented record. Linkin Park
        went on a hiatus when longtime lead vocalist Bennington died by suicide in July 2017. In April 2020, bassist
        Dave Farrell revealed the band was working on new music, though they have stated they will not be touring for
        the foreseeable future.

        Linkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world's best-selling music artists,
        having sold over 100 million records worldwide.[5] They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards,
        two Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards and three World Music
        Awards. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the
        new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band
        was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared
        as "The Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now" by Kerrang!.</p>
