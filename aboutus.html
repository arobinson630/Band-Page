        <h5>Chester Charles Bennington (March 20, 1976 â€“ July 20, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter,
            and
            occasional actor. He was best known as the lead vocalist of Linkin Park, but was also the lead
            vocalist of the bands Grey Daze, Dead by Sunrise, and Stone Temple Pilots.

            Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut
            album,
            Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success. The album was certified Diamond
            by
            the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the best-selling debut album of
            the
            decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many sales.[1] Linkin Park's
            following
            studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), continued the band's success.

            Bennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The band's debut
            album,
            Out of Ashes, was released on October 13, 2009. He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots
            in
            2013 to release the extended play record High Rise on October 8, 2013, via their own record
            label,
            Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely on Linkin Park. As an actor, he appeared in films
            such as
            Crank (2006), Crank: High Voltage (2009), and Saw 3D (2010).

            Bennington struggled with depression and substance abuse for most of his life, starting in his
            childhood. On July 20, 2017, he was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California;
            his
            death was ruled a suicide by hanging. Hit Parader magazine placed Bennington at number 46 on
            their
            list of the "Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time".[2] Bennington has been credited by several
            publications as one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation.[3] Writing for Billboard,
            Dan
            Weiss stated that Bennington "turned nu-metal universal".[4]</h5>

                earlier
                music
                spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, while their later music features more
                electronica
                and pop
                elements.

                Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid
                Theory
                (2000),

                Closer",
                "Crawling"
                and "In the End" all to chart highly on the Mainstream Rock chart; the latter crossed over
                to
                the pop
                chart.[1]
                Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success.[2] The band explored
                experimental
                sounds
                on
                their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).[3] By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was
                among the
                most
                successful and popular rock acts.
                Linkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world's best-selling
                music
                artists,
                having sold over 100 million records worldwide.[5] They have won two Grammy Awards, six

                the
                third-best of
                the
                new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list.
